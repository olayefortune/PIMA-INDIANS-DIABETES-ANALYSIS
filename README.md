Diabetes, is the world's leading noncommunicable disease (NCD), with cases nearly doubling since 1980. It is a chronic disease that occurs when the pancreas fails to produce enough insulin or when the body fails to utilise the insulin produced properly. This disease has no known cure. Diabetes is believed to be caused by genetic and environmental factors. Diabetes risk factors include ethnicity, a family history of diabetes, age, excess weight, an unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, and smoking. Furthermore, the failure to detect diabetes early has been linked to the development of other chronic diseases such as kidney disease. Again, pre-existing noncommunicable diseases pose a high risk for the patient because they are easily contracted and susceptible to infectious diseases like COVID-19.

The Pima Diabetes Research was a long-term study conducted by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) in the 1990s on the Pima Indian community in Arizona, USA. The aim of the study was to understand the factors contributing to the high prevalence of diabetes in the Pima Indian population, which has one of the highest rates of type 2 diabetes in the world.

This predictive analysis is committed to determining the chances of an individual having diabetes based on features like BMI, Blood Glucose Level, Age, etc.
